I'm currently migrating the master branch from the original source release over to BFG so check out that branch for an actual working system.



idTech4.net
===========

idTech4.net is a port of doom3 to C# and using XNA for rendering.


idEngine
--------

This is the port of the engine source code.

Done so far:

* core system.
* file system (implements pak processing but currently does not load files from pak's).
* partial render system.
* command system.
* cvar system.
* console.
* resource loading (decl, materials, user interfaces, scripts).
* user interface rendering and interaction code.
* partial game code.
* content management through XNA pipeline.
