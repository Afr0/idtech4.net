idTech4.net
===================

idTech4.net is a port of doom3 to c# with the end goal of running on the Xbox 360.

idEngine
-------------------

Contains the engine port.

idGame
-------------------

Contains the game portion of the release.  This currently does not compile.  Before the engine was released in November, a proxy layer (written in c++) was used to marshal engine and game calls between c++ and managed code.

idLib
-------------------

Contains shared code, this was primarily used with the proxy.  Unsure whether or not this will stay.
